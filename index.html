				<p>
					Centre Zen de la Main was founded in 1995 by Myōkyō, with the help of 
					generous donors. In 2009, its name was changed to Enpuku-ji with the move to its 
					new location at 4620 Saint-Dominique Street. Enpuku-ji is the temple name which was given to 
					Myōkyō by her teacher. The meaning of the kanji for Enpuku-ji is Temple of Full Prosperity. 
					Enpuku-ji is an affiliate centre of Rinzai-ji in Los Angeles, the motherhouse of a network of 
					centres which are committed to practicing Rinzai Zen as was taught by Kyōzan Jōshū Sasaki, 
					Rōshi. It has grown in its first decades to the point of being able to provide a strong 
					and consistent practice environment for members, newcomers, lay monks and practice residents.

					“The real Zen practice is to realize that you have the

					that you have the center of gravity which is one with

					the center of gravity of the universe, then you unify

					the world and you are unified by the world. You are

					embraced by the world. When you unify the world

					and you are unified by the world, that center of

					gravity is only one. So you cannot call it your own

					center of gravity. That center of gravity doesn’t

					need to call itself “self,” because there is no object.

					Since it unifies the world. There is no object. It is

					very difficult to understand, so you need more zazen

					to experience it.”<br><br>

<p>A short message as we enter the autumn season in Montreal with cool sunny days filled with fall fragrance!</p>

<p>The summer was a hot one and Enpuku-ji was sometimes sweltering for Listen and me. Things were quiet but steady in the zendo, with some closures to do with Myōkyō’s cataract surgeries and Listen’s spay operation.</p>

<p>As usual, there were many people who enquired about the <strong>newcomers session</strong> in early September and, so, there were two such sessions this past weekend. The October one will be held on October 11, noon to 1:30pm, and seats are almost filled. If you know of someone interested in Zen practice, please ask them to send an email.</p>

<p>We had a well-attended <strong>zazenkai</strong> on September 07, and will hold our next on Sunday, October 19, with extended hours, 8:30am – 5:00pm.</p>

<p>A <strong>three-day sesshin</strong> is in the works for January 02–04, with the customary 4am – 9pm schedule for the first two days and 4am – 5pm for the last day, Sunday, January 04. Please send an email if you have an interest in attending the sesshin.</p>

<p>Our <strong>Fall Equinox silent walk</strong> on the mountain will leave from the Zen Centre about 5:30am on Monday, September 22. If you would like to join Jan and me (we have been doing Equinox and Solstice walks for two and a half decades), let us know and I will provide more details.</p>

<p>A new event, emerging from discussions with my triad of fellow oshos, is a <strong>Bringing to the Moment</strong> ceremony/meditation, which will take place on Sunday, October 05, 10am – 11:30am. You are invited to come to remember and to honor those dear to you who have passed away in recent times, are close to death, or are in deep struggle currently. Participants may offer incense, place photos, flowers or other items on the butsudan, and/or say a few words about the one in mind. Others may simply be present in the zendo. (As some of you know, Enpuku-ji has a columbarium cabinet, and Myōkyō also performs Zen memorial services.)</p>

<p>We will be updating the website to add the <strong>cleaning period</strong> (nitten soji) which happens after the Saturday morning zazen for those able to stay for 25–30 minutes. Also, <strong>morning chanting</strong> will become official on Thursday mornings, with two zazen periods followed by chanting until 7:30am. More information will be forthcoming about <strong>Tenkū-ji</strong>, Seiun’s zendo in Colombia.</p>

<p>Enpuku-ji’s zafus need restuffing, a messy job best done outdoors. We have bundles of kapok, the stuffing material, in storage, and now just need masked manpower to get our zafus firm again. If you could lend a hand for a couple of hours or an afternoon, please let us know and we will organize a <strong>zafu-stuffing party</strong> of sorts while the weather is still good, most likely on a Saturday after zazen or a Sunday morning or afternoon.</p>

<p>Enpuku-ji is thankful for the many ways in which people contribute, with monthly monetary contributions as well as volunteering and in-kind gifts.</p>

				<strong>Seiun Thomas Henderson</strong>, autism and education specialist, was an integral part of Enpuku-ji for a decade, assisting Myōkyō with all of the programs/events

				that the Zen Centre offers, until he moved to Colombia in early 2023. Seiun has built a zendo on his farm and has established a weekly zazen group in the small city of Pereira. 

				

				<strong>Ekyō Diane Poissant</strong>, retired administrator and educator, lives in

				Kingston, Ontario. She established a zendo, Ryokusui-an, in her home

				in 2013, where a regular schedule of zazen is offered.

				<strong>Jion Ned Shepard</strong>, DJ, producer, musician and remixer, was a regular

				practitioner at Enpuku-ji for eight years before moving to

				Los Angeles, CA in 2012. He created a beautiful zendo in his

				Beverly Hills home for which Myōkyō bestowed the name, Kattō-an - Hermitage of Entangling Vines. Jion lends invaluable support to Rinzai-ji, Myōkyō's motherhouse, in LA.<br><br>
				The <strong>tokudo-shiki</strong> (ordination) ceremony for Seiun and Jion was held at Enpuku-ji in January, 2011 and that for Ekyō at Ryokusui-an in October, 2013.

					Volunteers and the understanding of dana have always been

					<p> Enpuku-ji has always had much help from members

						come to practice but want to support the existence and
	
						future of Enpuku-ji. We have help with the garden, the

					current Zen Centre dog, Listen, house maintenance,

					snow-shovelling, the website,

					translation, and so on. Most of this help

					goes unnoticed by others but is essential to the spirit and

				<h2>Montreal Zen Poetry Festival</h2>
				<div class="colored-line pull-left">

				<!-- TEXT -->
				<p>
					The Montreal Zen Poetry Festival was conceived of by several

					young poets who were practitioners at the Zen Centre

					around 2005. We held three festivals – 2007, 2009 and

					2011. We have

					been fortunate to have hosted the likes of Jane Hirshfield,

					Robert Bringhurst, Red Pine, Steve Sanfield, David Budbill,

					Peter Levitt, Chase Twichell, Kaz Tanahashi and others. The

					Montreal Zen Poetry Festival, a small niche festival, 

					led to rich collaborations with McGill University and with the

					Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival over

					the years.<br><br>

					Enpuku-ji published two collections of the works of our 2007

					and 2009 invitees under the imprint of Enpuku-ji Press. The

					collections, "Forget the Words" and "Words have no Meaning",

					are available for purchase at the Zen Centre.<br><br>

					
					The Rumi Li Zen Poetry Library, housed on the second

					floor at Enpuku-ji, has a special collection of Zen poetry and haiku

					works. People

					are invited to sit and read, by appointment.

					An offshoot of the Festivals has been the acquisition by

					Myōkyō and a former resident practitioner and Festival

					volunteer, Ian Sullivan Cant, of a small letterpress. <br><br>The

					rabbit fish logo, for the 2009 festival, was created by Ian

					who is a very fine zine artist and illustrator.</p>
