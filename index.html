				<p>
					Centre Zen de la Main was founded in 1995 by Myōkyō, with the help of 
					generous donors. In 2009, its name was changed to Enpuku-ji with the move to its 
					new location at 4620 Saint-Dominique Street. Enpuku-ji is the temple name which was given to 
					Myōkyō by her teacher. The meaning of the kanji for Enpuku-ji is Temple of Full Prosperity. 
					Enpuku-ji is an affiliate centre of Rinzai-ji in Los Angeles, the motherhouse of a network of 
					centres which are committed to practicing Rinzai Zen as was taught by Kyōzan Jōshū Sasaki, 
					Rōshi. It has grown in its first decades to the point of being able to provide a strong 
					and consistent practice environment for members, newcomers, lay monks and practice residents.

					the world and you are unified by the world. You are

					embraced by the world. When you unify the world

					center of gravity. That center of gravity doesn’t

					need to call itself “self,” because there is no object.

					Since it unifies the world. There is no object. It is

<p>It is with a light heart that New Year greetings come from Enpuku-ji! </p><p>

Despite the challenges in every realm in 2023, 2024 finds Myōkyō planted firmly back in Montreal after much travel
	over the past two years to help her Zen community in California. At the beginning of September, we welcomed 
	a new Enpuku-ji resident, Listen, a female Malamute two-month-old puppy. 

</p><p>The Zen Centre has been well supported with contributions both financial and otherwise. 
	We have received funds for a new refrigerator (after four years of poorly functioning ones), an air purifier, and a 
	hishiki (traditional zendo bowing mat). We have received a beautiful and very large scroll of Kuan Yin (Kannon) to 
	be installed this year in an alcove close to the zendo; an excellent cell phone to replace the ten-year-old one; 
	bountiful organic vegetables from an Eastern Townships farm; regular deliveries of vegetable curry; 
	many chauffeured trips with Listen to Puppy Class and for burger runs; and very-much-welcomed help with 
	updating the Enpuku-ji website.
 
</p>
						
<p>Weekly practice opportunities, both in-person and online, have increased since Myōkyō's return, 
	and newcomers sessions are back to their monthly schedule. There has been much adaptation on everyone's 
	part to the Zen Centre zendo arrangement, schedule and protocol, with a young pup. We hope that zazenkai 
	practice will be able to begin again in the early summer.

</p>
<p>Seiun, after many years of support with Enpuku-ji's schedule, has moved to Colombia, and has started a sitting group in Pereira, a close-by city to the farm where he lives and works the land. Seiun is still able to offer some on-line support for Enpuku-ji zazen. Myōkyō will travel to Colombia this year to lead a retreat and to bestow a name on Seiun's zendo, which was recently completed on the farm.

</p><p>We would like to thank those of you who have supported the Zen Centre over the years with one-time contributions as well as monthly contributions via CanadaHelps. The response was wonderful for the call-out for monthly assistance two years ago and everyone has continued with their contributions to date.

</p><p>Practice continues in a strong way at Enpuku-ji, and we hope to see some of you in the zendo this winter.


</p><p>With gratitude, and with wishes for you for a year of adventure and full feeling,

</p><p> Myōkyō, Abbot, and the Board of Directors

				<strong>Seiun Thomas Henderson</strong>, autism and education specialist, was an integral part of Enpuku-ji for a decade, assisting Myōkyō with all of the programs/events

				that the Zen Centre offers, until he moved to Colombia in early 2023. Seiun has built a zendo on his farm and has established a weekly zazen group in the small city of Pereira. 

				

				<strong>Ekyō Diane Poissant</strong>, retired administrator and educator, lives in

				Kingston, Ontario. She established a zendo, Ryokusui-an, in her home

				in 2013, where a regular schedule of zazen is offered.

				<strong>Jion Ned Shepard</strong>, DJ, producer, musician and remixer, was a regular

				practitioner at Enpuku-ji for eight years before moving to

				Los Angeles, CA in 2012. He created a beautiful zendo in his

				Beverly Hills home for which Myōkyō bestowed the name, Kattō-an - Hermitage of Entangling Vines. Jion lends invaluable support to Rinzai-ji, Myōkyō's motherhouse, in LA.<br><br>
				The <strong>tokudo-shiki</strong> (ordination) ceremony for Seiun and Jion was held at Enpuku-ji in January, 2011 and that for Ekyō at Ryokusui-an in October, 2013.

				<h2>Montreal Zen Poetry Festival</h2>

				<!-- TEXT -->
				<p>
					The Montreal Zen Poetry Festival was conceived of by several

					young poets who were practitioners at the Zen Centre

					around 2005. We held three festivals – 2007, 2009 and

					2011. We have

					been fortunate to have hosted the likes of Jane Hirshfield,

					Robert Bringhurst, Red Pine, Steve Sanfield, David Budbill,

					Peter Levitt, Chase Twichell, Kaz Tanahashi and others. The

					Montreal Zen Poetry Festival, a small niche festival, 

					led to rich collaborations with McGill University and with the

					Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival over

					the years.<br><br>

					Enpuku-ji published two collections of the works of our 2007

					and 2009 invitees under the imprint of Enpuku-ji Press. The

					collections, "Forget the Words" and "Words have no Meaning",

					are available for purchase at the Zen Centre.<br><br>

					
					The Rumi Li Zen Poetry Library, housed on the second

					floor at Enpuku-ji, has a special collection of Zen poetry and haiku

					works. People

					are invited to sit and read, by appointment.

					An offshoot of the Festivals has been the acquisition by

					Myōkyō and a former resident practitioner and Festival

					volunteer, Ian Sullivan Cant, of a small letterpress. <br><br>The

					rabbit fish logo, for the 2009 festival, was created by Ian

					who is a very fine zine artist and illustrator.</p>

					Enpuku-ji is incorporated under Federal law as a charitable

					organization and, as such, issues tax receipts for donations and

					membership payments via CanadaHelps. The Centre is supported by general donations,

					membership payments, retreat and ceremony fees, resident and

					guest practitioner income and donations to the Abbot, Membership, General Donations, Practice Scholarship and Temple Maintenance Funds. <br><br>
					
					Those attending regularly

					are asked to contribute as a member after

					their newcomers session.

					Donations and membership payments are payable online through

					CanadaHelps.

					To make such a payment via CanadaHelps,

					simply click on the “Contribute” button on this page. A screen with

					the Enpuku-ji logo will appear. Then choose "Donate Monthly" for a

					membership payment and follow the instructions. If you wish to make

					a single donation, click on "Donate Now" and, on the next screen,

					after entering the amount, go to “Fund/Designation” and choose

					which fund you would like to contribute to. CanadaHelps allows

					donors to download a tax receipt at any time.

					Payments other than donations and membership payments are not

					tax-receiptable and are made by Interac e-transfer to info@enpuku-ji.org.
