				<p>
					Centre Zen de la Main was founded in 1995 by Myōkyō, with the help of generous donors. In 2009, its name was changed to Enpuku-ji with the move to its new location at 4620 Saint-Dominique Street. Enpuku-ji is the temple name which was given to Myōkyō by her teacher. The meaning of the kanji for Enpuku-ji is Temple of Full Prosperity. Enpuku-ji is an affiliate centre of Rinzai-ji in Los Angeles, the motherhouse of a network of centres which are committed to practicing Rinzai Zen as was taught by Kyōzan Jōshū Sasaki, Roshi. It has grown in its first two decades to the point of being able to provide a strong and consistent practice environment for members, newcomers, lay monks and practice residents.

					“The real Zen practice is to realize that you have the

					center of gravity of the universe. When you realize

					that you have the center of gravity which is one with

					the center of gravity of the universe, then you unify

					the world and you are unified by the world. You are

					embraced by the world. When you unify the world

					and you are unified by the world, that center of

					gravity is only one. So you cannot call it your own

					center of gravity. That center of gravity doesn’t

					need to call itself “self,” because there is no object.

					Since it unifies the world. There is no object. It is

					very difficult to understand, so you need more zazen

					to experience it.”<br><br>

					    In this time of COVID-19, Enpuku-ji, at the beginning of March, limited the practitioners coming to the Zen Centre in alignment with travel and symptom restrictions, and, the week of March 16, closed its doors for the time being and started to offer Zoom zazen sessions. The Zen Centre increased the number of zazen opportunities, adding four new zazen times to the schedule on the website, and held a Zoom zazenkai on Saturday, April 04.</p>
						<p>If you have practiced at Enpuku-ji in the past or have practiced with one of Myokyo's fellow monks, and are interested in joining the Zoom zazen sessions, we ask that you send an email to <strong>info@enpuku-ji.org</strong> for further instructions on joining. At this point in time, there will be no opportunity for newcomers to practice at Enpuku-ji as there will be no instruction sessions for the next months. Please contact us at the same email address if you would have an interest in an online live instruction session in the summer/autumn.</p>
						<p>Because of the pandemic, Enpuku-ji Zen is not receiving guests as it has for the last seven years. This income was essential for covering the hefty rent for Enpuku-ji. If you have benefited from having practiced at the Zen Centre in the past, we would ask you to consider a contribution to help with expenses as we go forward. The link for making contributions through CanadaHelps is to be found elsewhere on the website. The help in many forms received thus far is greatly appreciated.</p>

					  <h6>Fall Sangha Meeting and &quot;Mind on the Page&quot; Writing Workshop</h6>
					  <p>The weekend of November 07/08, Gento, Myokyo's brother monk from Los Angeles, came to Montreal and worked with the Enpuku-ji sangha for two events.</p>
					  <p>The fall sangha meeting, at Enpuku-ji on the Saturday from 11:30am to 1pm, accompanied by our apple tree offerings, fashioned into apple crisp, was attended by friends, supporters and practitioners, past and present, of the Zen Centre. The meeting took the form of a Listening Circle or Council practice. Participants were asked to speak from the heart, spontaneously, without advance preparation or response to what others have said. The amazing aspects of a Listening Circle are that there is no cross-talk during the practice and also that one is asked to listen completely from the heart. Gento had two guiding questions for the Listening Circle participants. </p>
					  <p>&quot;Mind on the Page&quot;</p>
					  <p>Gento led a writing workshop for twelve people on the Sunday at Enpuku-ji, in the warmth of the zendo. The writing workshop was for those of us who are not writers but who have a meditation practice, and was appreciated by the attendees - a few tears and some laughter as we all read our work.</p>
					  <p>This event was the first in the Enpuku-ji Literary Series, an out-cropping of the Montreal Zen Poetry Festivals, held in 2007, 2009 and 2011.</p>

						<h6>Myokyo and Kyozan</h6>
						<p>As many of you know, Myokyo has been slowly transitioning to Enpuku-ji from her residence in the former Zen Centre house, together with Kyozan. A lot of changes and re-arranging of the Enpuku-ji upstairs have kept Myokyo and Robert, regular volunteer, very busy over the last few weeks. A fundraising effort for a vacuum cleaner, with special animal hair attachments, commenced in early November and quickly, with two major donations and many smaller ones, reached close to the total cost. If you would like to contribute a small amount, we have about forty dollars to go. </p>
						<p>Everyone coming for practice has been very patient in the last three weeks with Kyozan, who has been &quot;joining&quot; the zendo... Rest assured that some training is happening but moves, Myokyo now realizes, are very stressful for dogs, so there will be some more adjustment time for Kyozan.</p>

						<h6>Enpuku-ji community events</h6>
						<p><em>Soup for Syria</em></p>
						<p>Enpuku-ji will open its doors on Sunday, January 17, from 2 to 4pm for people to come and enjoy a bowl of hot soup and/or to take a quart of soup home for dinner. </p>
						<p>A recipe book, <em>Soup for Syria</em>, filled with fabulous recipes from over 80 acclaimed chefs and beautiful photographs of Syrian people, has been produced by Barbara Abdeni Massaad, who volunteers in a soup kitchen in Syria. Proceeds from the sale of this cookbook will be donated to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR to provide urgently needed food relief for Syrian refugees. Soup events are being encouraged to raise awareness of the Syrian people's dilemma.</p>
						<p>We would like to ask for volunteers to help with shopping, to prepare three soups from the book at Enpuku-ji, and to set up/clean up for the event. $4 of each $7 bowl of soup/$8 of each $14 quart (if you bring your own jar) will go to UNHCR. </p>
						<p><em>Silent Solstice Walk</em></p>
					  <p>On Monday, December 21, at 6:15am, some of us will leave from Enpuku-ji for a silent walk up to and around the mountain in honour of Winter Solstice, technically happening at 11:49pm. Please, if you would like to join us, bring a thermos of a warm beverage and some snacks. Jan and Myokyo have done a much earlier Summer Solstice walk several times but this will be the first for Winter Solstice. Let Myokyo know if you are interested in coming.</p>

						<p>A huge amount of appreciation for the almost twenty-one years of inhabiting 30, Vallieres, the old Zen Centre, goes to Jikan Leonard Cohen, Myokyo's fellow practitioner and close friend of her teacher until his death in 2014.</p>

				<strong>Seiun Thomas Henderson</strong> has been an integral part of Enpuku-ji in

				the last few years, assisting Myōkyō with all of the programs/events

				that the Zen Centre offers. Seiun is currently the Director General

				of Giant Steps, a school for students on the autism spectrum, in

				Montreal.

				<strong>Ekyō Diane Poissant</strong>, retired administrator and educator, lives in

				Kingston, Ontario, and established a zendo, Ryokusui-an, in her home

				in 2013. Ekyō offers a regular schedule of zazen, day retreats and	

				some Buddha ceremonies.

				<strong>Jion Ned Shepard</strong>, DJ, producer, and remixer, was a regular

				practitioner at Enpuku-ji for ten years before recently moving to

				Los Angeles, CA. He has created a beautiful zendo, Kattō-an, in his

				Beverley Hills home.<br><br>
				The <strong>tokudo-shiki</strong> (ordination) ceremony for Seiun and Jion was held at Enpuku-ji in January, 2011 and that for Ekyō at Ryokusui-an in October, 2013.

					Volunteers and the understanding of dana have always been

					important aspects of the Zen Centre. Dana is considered to

					be the Buddhist practice of cultivating generosity, or some

					might say, selfless spontaneous giving.

					Enpuku-ji has always had much help from members

					and from friends of the Zen Centre, those who do not

					come to practice but want to support the existence and

					future of Enpuku-ji. We have help with the garden, the

					current Zen Centre dog, Kyōzan, garage sales, fundraising

					events, Zen cooking classes, house maintenance,

					snow-shovelling, cleaning for Zen guests, the website,

					translation, fundraising dinners, and so on. Most of this help

					goes unnoticed by others but is essential to the spirit and

					stewardship of Enpuku-ji.

				<h2>Montreal Zen Poetry Festival</h2>
				<div class="colored-line pull-left">
				</div>
				
				<!-- TEXT -->
				<p>
					The Montreal Zen Poetry Festival was conceived of by several

					young poets who were practitioners at the Zen Centre

					around 2005. We held three festivals – 2007, 2009 and

					2011 – and will possibly organize another for 2017. We have

					been fortunate to have hosted the likes of Jane Hirshfield,

					Robert Bringhurst, Red Pine, Steve Sanfield, David Budbill,

					Peter Levitt, Chase Twichell, Kaz Tanahashi and others. The

					Montreal Zen Poetry Festival is a small niche festival, and has

					led to rich collaborations with McGill University and with the

					Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival over

					the years.<br><br>

					Enpuku-ji published two collections of the works of our 2007

					and 2009 invitees under the imprint of Enpuku-ji Press. The

					collections, Forget the Words and Words have no Meaning,

					are available for purchase at the Zen Centre.

					We continue to host poetry readings and calligraphy

					workshops with Kaz Tanahashi as extensions of the Festival

					and to support the poets who have practiced Zen at Enpuku-ji.<br><br>

					The Rumi Li Zen Poetry Library, housed on the second

					floor at Enpuku-ji, has a special collection of most of Gary

					Snyder's poetry and essays, some of Philip Whalen's work,

					the works of our Festival invitees and a collection of haiku

					works donated to the Zen Centre several years ago. People

					are invited to sit and read, by appointment.

					An offshoot of the Festivals has been the acquisition by

					Myōkyō and a former resident practitioner and Festival

					volunteer, Ian Sullivan Cant, of a small letterpress. <br><br>The

					rabbit fish logo, for the 2009 festival, was created by Ian

					who is a very fine zine artist and illustrator.</p>

					Enpuku-ji is incorporated under Federal law as a charitable

					organization and, as such, issues tax receipts for donations and

					membership payments. The Centre is supported by general donations,

					membership payments, retreat and ceremony fees, resident and

					guest practitioner income and donations to the Abbess, Monk Study

					and Travel, and Zen Poetry Festival Funds. Those attending regularly

					are asked to contribute as a member starting with the month after

					their introduction to Enpuku-ji practice.

					Donations and membership payments are payable online through

					CanadaHelps or by cash or cheque at the Zen Centre.

					To make a donation or a membership payment via CanadaHelps,

					simply click on the “Contribute” button on this page. A screen with

					the Enpuku-ji logo will appear. Then choose "Donate Monthly" for a

					membership payment and follow the instructions. If you wish to make

					a single donation, click on "Donate Now" and, on the next screen,

					after entering the amount, go to “Fund/Designation” and choose

					which fund you would like to contribute to. CanadaHelps allows

					donors to download a tax receipt at any time.

					Payments other than donations and membership payments are not

					tax-receiptable and may be made by cheque, made out to “Enpukuji”,

					or in cash.
